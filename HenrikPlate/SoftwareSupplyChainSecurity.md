# Chapter on Software Supply Chain Security 

Overall idea: Highlight challenges and contrast with existing efforts from industry/academia to clarify which ones are covered (or at least worked on), and which ones, in our opinion, are not looked at sufficiently.

- Introduction, Motivation and Terminology
    - Roles (developers, suppliers, consumers)
    - Types of dependencies (across the stack and lifecycle, e.g. container deps, library deps or service providers invoked at runtime)
    - High-level challenge: Build trustworthy software out of untrusted components (and where are trust boundaries in the 1st place)
    - Inhibiting innovation through regulation/controls (?)

- Visibility / Context Awareness
    - Lookup and comparison of alternative OSS components is difficult, e.g. to find components with equivalent features
    - Architecture comprehension
        - Automated discovery of component capabilities (in general, independent of specific use-cases)
        - Understand how a given component (which features) are used in a specific application context, esp. for transitive components
        - Which features are used, what kind of app data flows into the component and its data sinks, which functions and methods are used, etc.
    - Prioritization of vulns
        - Reachability vs. exploitability
        - Programming languages (?)
        - Different approaches: Shift-left vs. runtime agents
    - Debloating

- Metrics
    - Risk metrics (for better component selection and comparison), e.g. risk of maintainers disappearing or use of sensitive APIs
    - Existing works: Bus factor, OSSF Scorecards, [GUAC](https://github.com/guacsec/guac) (for entire dep trees)
    - What are differences between metrics for commercial and OSS supply chain components (if any)?

- Benchmarks
    - Consumers can hardly verify security tool results (SBOM generators, or impact assessments based on data or control flow analysis, etc.)
    - Example SBOMs (use food analogy)
        - Define what should be included in SBOMs (cf. [The Minimum Elements For a Software Bill of Materials ](https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/sbom_minimum_elements_report.pdf))
        - Do documented checks (and corresponding attestations) make it unnecessary to keep track of every detailed component?
        - This will again result/require trust in private or public sector organizations (and their tools)
    - Increase tool verifiablity (does in-toto fit here?)
    - Creation and maintenance of independent Benchmarks Ã  la https://www.dacapobench.org/ by independent, non-profit organizations

- Cloud Service Providers
    - [Shared Responsiblity Model](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/cloud-security/shared-responsibility-model/) for Cloud Security does not apply to OSS consumption. Maybe explain the main differences in a paragraph. 
    - Larger orgs follow a multi-cloud strategy to mitigate risks

- Human Factors
    - Summary of existing works (Dominique?)
    - What are the true costs of using open source components (e.g., to assess newly disclosed vulns, vet new component versions or perform updates)
    - What are problems if humans are not properly considered (their motivations, personal risks, ...)
        - Human-driven processes are not well-structured and bring a lot of insecurity
        - Comprimised developers or QA persons (even conctracters) pose a risk (cf. recent attacks)
        - (Non-)Usable tooling that does not fit into workflows, e.g. issue prioritization and documentation
        - Usable and acceptable authentication mechanisms for developers
        - Cognitive biases/conflicts of stakeholders, information needs, etc.

- The role of private orgs in supply chain security
    - Incentive structure
    - Participation in open source foundations (only strategic projects get a lot of attention)
    - For example, C# is heavily influenced by MS
    - Some can be considered critical infrastructure operators, e.g., package registries
        - Implicit trust assumptions of developers ("it's on npm, thus, it has been checked")
        - Should they be run by private organizations, despite their importance?
        - How comes that few people take decisions for the whole community?
        - How to design a secure package registry?
    - Incentivize information sharing of private orgs to prevent silos (e.g., every SCA vendor has its own public database with vuln info about open source components)
